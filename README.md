# A lightweight, actively controlled prosthetic with affordable sensors

## Novel muscle activity detection
Electromyography (EMG) sensing technology is currently limited by its low signal to noise ratio, high cost, and scarce availability for quality products. Mechanomyography (MMG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) appear to be a promising alternatives that use affordable components to detect muscle activity. Previous studies suggest that MMG and PPG can potentially provide more accurate readings of muscular activity than EMG with less signal processing techniques. 

## Flexible materials and biomimetic joints
Traditional prosthetic devices using EMG control lack the ability of abduction. A new approach to prosthetics using flexible materials could allow for more complex gestures and improved dexterity when manipulating objects. Advancements in the field of 3D printing can allow for semi-hollow devices made of stretchable materials, like thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), to be employed without sacrificing resilience to the elements. Combining a novel MMG control system with a prosthetic with hexagonal infill 3D printing pattern and biomimetic joints containing flexible MCP ligaments can allow for a lighter, more affordable, and durable prosthetic device.
